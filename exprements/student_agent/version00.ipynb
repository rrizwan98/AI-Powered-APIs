      "Assistant: The poisonous plant found in New York parks is Poison Ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Exposure to Poison Ivy can cause severe skin irritation, known as contact dermatitis. Symptoms include redness, itching, swelling, and blisters. The rash can be extremely uncomfortable and can take several weeks to heal. Children are at particular risk because their skin is more sensitive and they may not be aware of the dangers of the plant.\n",

      "Safety Recommendations:\n",
      "1. Learn to identify Poison Ivy and other poisonous plants common in your area.\n",
      "2. Wear long sleeves, pants, and gloves when working in areas where Poison Ivy may be present.\n",
      "3. If you come into contact with Poison Ivy, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water as soon as possible.\n",
      "4. Apply a calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream to help relieve itching and inflammation.\n",
